# XML Injector version 2
# by Scumbumbo @ MTS
#
# The detection module is used to turn off the DramaNode which is used to detect the absence
# of XML Injector.  By disabling that drama node the game will not alert players that they need
# to download XML Injector.
#
# This mod is intended as a standard for modder's to use as a shared library.  Please do not
# distribute any modifications anywhere other than the mod's main download site.  Modification
# suggestions and bug notices should be communicated to the maintainer, currently Scumbumbo at
