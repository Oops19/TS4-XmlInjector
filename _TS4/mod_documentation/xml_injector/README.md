# TS4 XML Injector

The XML injector by scumbumbo with proper S4CL based logging.

The XML Injector compatibility version is '4', it is not tied to the version number on GitHub.

## Compatibility

This mod is not compatible with the original XML injector.
Use either the original or this mod.

## Refactoring

* All global methods and parameters have been wrapped into classes.
* Logging is now S4CL based.
* Injection methods and the injection into on_loading_screen_animation_finished have been removed.

The original source code is available at https://gitlab.com/scumbumbo/xml-injector/-/tree/master

## Note
I converted it to use S4CL logging after some issues which were not related to the mod itself.
But without detailed logging one never knows.


# Addendum

## Game compatibility
This mod has been tested with `The Sims 4` 1.107.112, S4CL 3.4, TS4Lib 0.3.20 (2024-05).
It is expected to be compatible with many upcoming releases of TS4, S4CL and TS4Lib.

## Dependencies
Download the ZIP file, not the sources.
* [This Mod](../../releases/latest)

All are available for free.

## Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.

## Usage Tracking / Privacy
This mod does not send any data to tracking servers. The code is open source, not obfuscated, and can be reviewed.

Some log entries in the log file ('mod_logs' folder) may contain the local username, especially if files are not found (WARN, ERROR).
